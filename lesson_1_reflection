How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The FC command in windows listed the differences after a heading of the file name.
The diff command in Git Bash used plus and minusses to represent the changes between the two files.
By seeing the changes you could easily see the changes between the two files, and as such the differences, and the bug that was introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By allowing me to see the changes, and the optimisations I have created as I have learnt and developed as a programmer.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Maunal Commit
Pros - can choose to commit in logical stages
Cons - may wait too long to commit
     - may include too many fixes for one commit
Auto Saving
Pros - allow to commit if user is forgetful
Cons - may commit in the middle of a logical operation
     - may commit when code is not working
